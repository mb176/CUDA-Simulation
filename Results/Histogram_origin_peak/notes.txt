Everything except the gamma=1.5, eta = 1.4 plot fits the predictions from
the estimate of the PDF at the origin.
The fits for the peak height don't really follow the t^-gamma pattern from the
very rough estimate and should probably not be shown. However we see that
the histogram for large gamma has barely any peak at all, which shows that it is
qualitatively right.
In total that means we have 4 possible peaks whose size is manged by the gamma:
 - eta != nu: no peak
 - eta = nu < 1: Peak but finite pdf behind it (smaller when gamma larger)
 - eta = nu > 1: Sharp peak, nothing behind it
 - very large gamma: peak almost non-existant
